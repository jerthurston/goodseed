                <h1>Terms of Service for GoodSeed</h1>
                <p className="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 26, 2023</p>

                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>Welcome to GoodSeed. These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of the GoodSeed website, content, and services (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;).</p>
                <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these Terms, you may not access or use the Service.</p>

                <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
                <p>GoodSeed provides a search platform for products and shopping. Users can search for products, view details, and save favorites. The Service links to external merchant sites via affiliate links.</p>
                <p>GoodSeed does not sell products itself; instead, it provides a convenient link to retailers. When you click an affiliate link and make a purchase from a retailer, GoodSeed may earn a commission. We clearly identify affiliate links to maintain transparency, in accordance with FTC guidelines.</p>

                <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
                <p>You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, to use the Service on your own. If you are under this age, you may only use the Service with the involvement, supervision, and consent of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

                <h2>4. Account Registration</h2>
                <p>You may create an account to access certain features of the Service. You agree to provide accurate and complete information during registration and to keep your account credentials secure. You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account and for promptly notifying us of any unauthorized use.</p>

                <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
                <p>You agree not to misuse the Service. In particular, you agree not to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations or infringe upon the rights of others.</li>
                    <li>Engage in spamming, phishing, harassing, or sending unsolicited bulk emails.</li>
                    <li>Introduce any viruses, trojans, worms, or other malicious or technologically harmful code.</li>
                    <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to, interfere with, damage, or disrupt any parts of the Service.</li>
                    <li>Use any robot, spider, or other automated device or process to scrape, collect data, or access the Service for any purpose without our express written permission.</li>

                    <li>Use the Service for any illegal, fraudulent, or abusive purpose.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. User-Generated Content</h2>
                <p>If the Service allows you to post, link, or otherwise make available content (&quot;User Content&quot;), you retain ownership of that content. However, by posting User Content, you grant GoodSeed a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to use, copy, modify, distribute, and display it in connection with the Service.</p>
                <p>You represent and warrant that you have the necessary rights to post the User Content and that it does not violate these Terms or any applicable law. GoodSeed has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor, edit, or remove any User Content. We are not responsible for User Content; users are solely responsible for their own posts.</p>

                <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>All content on the Service, including text, graphics, logos, code, and software, is the property of GoodSeed or its licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Service for your personal, non-commercial use as intended. Any other use is strictly prohibited.</p>

                <h2>8. Links to Third-Party Sites</h2>
                <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services (e.g., retailers) that are not owned or controlled by GoodSeed. These links are provided for your convenience only.</p>
                <p>GoodSeed has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. You acknowledge and agree that GoodSeed shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of any such content or services.</p>

                <h2>9. Termination</h2>
                <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, if you breach these Terms.</p>
                <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may do so by discontinuing use of the Service. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

                <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
                <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GOODSEED DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
                <p>WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>

                <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL GOODSEED, ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OR EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLES, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR YOUR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.</p>
                <p>OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICE, IF ANYTHING.</p>

                <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
                <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless GoodSeed and its directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney&apos;s fees) resulting from or arising out of your use of and access to the Service, or your violation of these Terms.</p>

                <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>

Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

                <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute related to these Terms will be resolved exclusively in the courts of Ontario.</p>
